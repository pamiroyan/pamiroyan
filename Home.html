          <h3>How to style straight hair: cheat with a headband!</h3>
          <p>It widely accepted that straight hair is manageable, easy to style and generally quite well behaved. To an extent this is true, but not always. Straight hair, especially fine hair, can have a habit of losing its shape and style more easily than other hair textures. This makes styling a straight haircut seem a little harder than styling a different hair type.

There is one universal method that works for just about every hairstyle out there, especially straight fine hair: accessorizing!

Make a statement
Headpieces are a great way to add extra detail to your look with no more effort than it takes to lift them onto your head. Just like when you get bangs cut in, a headband can totally change your hairstyle, giving it a whole new lease of life.

There are a lot of different headpieces to choose from, including floral headbands, ribbons and even 1950's style headscarves!

          <h3>Our Favorite Short Hairstyles for Men</h3>
          <p>They might be growing their hair to stay on-trend these days, but most (and we mean, almost all!) men look quite dapper in short hairstyles. Some keep a trimmed mane because they find it easier to manage, while most others sport short cropped hair because of the nature of their jobs. Men with short hair also find it difficult to switch their hairstyles very frequently and usually wear one signature style for years!</p>

  <h3>THE BEST HAIR STYLIST</h3>
